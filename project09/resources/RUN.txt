Analysis of all_array.jpg

Note: The numbers of the x axis is not the recursion limit but a scale to the recursion limit
Each unit represents 2 units of recursion limit.(eg 25 represent 50)

The most stable points(optimal recursion) occurs when the the recursion limit is
between 220 and 235. We can see that most of the graphs has a flat line.

The highest peaking point for 3 of the graphs occurs when the recursion limit is
between 250 and 260. This includes the 370000, 770000, 1570000 array graphs.

The lowest peaking point in the graph is when the graph 1570000 recursion limit reaches 260
This occur maybe due to the large size of array making the spikes more prominent.

Conclusion, the bigger the size of the array, then the spikes (lowest and highest) will be much
steeper and clearer compared to the other graphs. While the smaller sized arrays will more regions
of flat area and less spikes.
